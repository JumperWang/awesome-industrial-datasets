### Data Set Information  
The data sets are arranged according to the cause of the poor performance of the control loops. These categories are described in Bauer et al. (2016) and are ordered according to how often they occur in industrial processes.

The repository is described in the following paper. For valve stiction, a comparative study was conducted using industrial data that is also available on this repository (Bacci di Capaci et al., 2016). This data repository wants to encourage the development of similar studies.
### Databases Included 
- Plantwide Data 
- Quantization
